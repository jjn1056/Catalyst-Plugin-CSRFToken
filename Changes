1.001 - 2025-03-09
  - Back compatibility warning: The previous version has been buggy
    for quite a while due to errors I made in version 0.001 and I've
    tried to fix these over the past few years with only part success.
    Additionally some of its comparison code is not up to modern
    cryptographic standards. As a result the guts are now substantially changed.
    I did my best to be compatible in terms of the public API. This works
    for all my existing code but please shout out if you run into issues.
    FWIW I believe you should upgrade as I consider previous versions
    insecure and I will be removing them from CPAN in the future.
